The Lutron lighting products give you the ability to control all the lights in your home from one location with an easy-to-use button control. Lutron allows you to preset lighting "scenes" for enjoying your favorite moods and events (such as a party, movie, or dinner), extends bulb life, and provides unique energy savings and home security features. Most Lutron solutions can be retrofitted to your home with little to no new wiring, making them accessible for your next renovation project.`,
